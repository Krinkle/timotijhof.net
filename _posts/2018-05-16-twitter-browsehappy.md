> Six years ago (in 2012), I was looking for a newsletter about browser releases. At the time, my motivation was to test and update the jQuery TestSwarm framework for each new browser release. I found a simple overview at [browsehappy.com](https://browsehappy.com/), by [@WordPress](https://twitter.com/WordPress).  <small>(1/)</small>

> Lacking RSS, I decided to simply check it on a regular basis, and created [@browsehappy](https://twitter.com/browsehappy) on Twitter for others also looking to follow browser releases, with links to relevant blog posts and documentation. Then, one day…  <small>(2/)</small>

> One day, Chrome's version number was missing on Browse Happy's homepage. Browse Happy is open-sourced at <https://github.com/WordPress/browsehappy>, which helped me find that its data actually comes from Wikipedia! Specifically, it scraped markup from article infoboxes, and extracted the version with some string operations.  <small>(3/)</small>

> Those string operations made assumptions about the wiki's internal templates, which no longer held up after some edits to the Google Chrome article on Wikipedia. This repeated itself a number of times…  <small>(4/)</small>

> After three years of moderating the feed I took a break, and never got back. TestSwarm no longer had its own browser detection, and for web-dev interests, much better newsletters sprung into existence. Main one for me is [webplatform.news](https://webplatform.news), by [@simevidas](https://twitter.com/simevidas).  <small>(7/)</small>

> Back to @browsehappy.… as part of digital spring cleaning, I decided I shouldn’t be owner [@browsehappy](https://twitter.com/browsehappy) on Twitter, especially given it’s now dormant. I’ve reached out to [@Automattic](https://twitter.com/Automattic) and worked out a transfer.  <small>(8/)</small>
