Last couple of weeks I’ve been working on a new project, based on an ad-hoc i18n solution I had in some of my tools.

Toolserver Intuition is new tool (a “meta-tool”, if you will) that end-users won’t interact much directly, but it is used inside other tools. Both my own tools and tools by other developers.

I worked with [translatewiki.net](https://translatewiki.net/) and set up [a new project](https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Intuition) there.

The translations themselves and the framework around it is open-sourced in Wikimedia SVN: [https://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/tools/ToolserverI18N](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/diffusion/SVN/browse/trunk/tools/ToolserverI18N/).

More technical details and a short guide on how to implement it (if you’re a Toolserver developer as well) can be found on the [Intuition docs](https://github.com/Krinkle/intuition/wiki/Documentation).

**Update 2013-10-18**: Code has moved to GitHub: <https://github.com/Krinkle/intuition>.
